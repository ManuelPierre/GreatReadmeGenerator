GreatReadMEGenerator

I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
My homework creates a professional readme for a project.  When the user is prompted for information about my application repository a quality, professional README.md will be generated with the title of their project and headings Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
When they input the project title, then it is shown as the title of the Readme.  When the user enters escription, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then there are corresponding headings for each.  
When the user inputs the license for their project then a badge is posted to readme with the emblem for the license.  When the user enters their github username then a link to their Github is posted to the questions section.
The user is prompted for their email address and when that is entered it is added to the questions section.  When you click the links in the Table of Contents it goes to the corresponding sections.
